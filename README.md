# multiply-game

Hello, This is a project done by Roxanne, Helena, Raima and Matthaeus for WarwickTECH 2021. Using html,css and JS, all  you got to do is answer multiplications, for each wrong answer one life is lost, and for each right answer , you get 5 points. There are 20 questions so if u complete all 20 and score a point of 100, you are done practicing for the day. We hope this project makes learning multiplications fun for primary school kids or for anyone learning multiplications. You can access our project by clicking the following link:
